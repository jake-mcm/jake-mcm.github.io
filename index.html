    <br> My name is Jake McManus. I was born and raised in Southern California,
    <br>and I am a 5th year VCD major at Cal Poly Pomona. My goal is to become an art educator,
    <br>hopefully a professor. I have a boyfriend named Eli who also goes to Cal Poly and is
    <br>a dual Polisci/History major. He also wants to teach.<br>
